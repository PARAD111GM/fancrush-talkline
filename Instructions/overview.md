# Project Overview: Fancrush - Talkline

**Version:** 1.0 (Phase 1 - MVP Focus)
**Date:** 2025-04-03

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the Fancrush - Talkline project. The goal is to create a web application enabling fans to have simulated phone conversations with AI-powered digital twins of their favorite online influencers.

## 2. Goals

* **Primary Goal:** Provide fans with a novel and engaging way to interact with influencers they follow.
* **Secondary Goals:**
    * Create a new revenue stream for online influencers.
    * Build a scalable platform capable of supporting multiple influencers and a large user base.
    * Offer a seamless user experience from discovery to conversation.
* **MVP Goal (Phase 1):** Validate the core fan experience â€“ demo call, signup, purchasing minutes, and initiating paid PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) calls with manually onboarded influencers.

## 3. Core Concept

Fans visit a dedicated landing page for a specific influencer, linked from the influencer's social media bio (e.g., LinkTree). They can initiate a short (2-minute) demo call directly in their browser using the Vapi.ai Web SDK. To continue talking, users must sign up, purchase prepaid minute packs via Stripe, and can then initiate longer calls where the system connects their actual phone number to the AI twin via Twilio (or a similar PSTN provider). The AI interaction aims to mimic the influencer's voice and personality, though it's explicitly disclosed as an AI simulation in the fine print/terms.

## 4. Target Audience

* **Primary:** Fans and followers of online influencers (Instagram, TikTok, OnlyFans, etc.) seeking deeper connection or novel interaction.
* **Secondary:** Online influencers looking for new monetization methods and fan engagement tools.

## 5. Project Scope (Phased)

* **Phase 1 (MVP):** Focus on the core fan journey with manually configured influencer profiles and AI twins. Includes landing page, web demo call, user auth, minute purchasing, and PSTN call initiation/bridging. Manual admin via Supabase Studio.
* **Phase 2:** Introduce influencer self-service onboarding (application, asset upload) and a basic web-based admin panel.
* **Phase 3:** Automate AI twin creation (voice cloning, personality extraction), implement influencer payouts (Stripe Connect), and enhance dashboards.
* **Phase 4:** Polish, advanced features (auto-top-up, affiliate program), optimizations.

*(This document focuses primarily on Phase 1)*

## 6. Supporting Documentation Summary
